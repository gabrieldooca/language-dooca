# language-dooca package

Dooca (Liquid) language support for Atom.

It works with the language-gfm repository to provide syntax highlighting for Liquid and HTML embedded in markdown files (which occurs, for example, on Jekyll blogs).

If you are using the package [language-liquid package](https://atom.io/packages/language-liquid) please disable, this causes conflict with the snippets.
